# Chat Application

This is a simple chat app via Django.
It opens a soket and store data in Redis via `dephne` and `channels`.

for now, it's just sends message and never store them separately and
these messages can read by anyone who logged in to the system!!!

I will add rest framework to it, so that every users get a their own access and refresh tokens to
communicate with each other.
